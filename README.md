Dungeon
=======
A 3D dungeon crawler game, in the style of Dungeon Master, and especially Legend of Grimrock.

![A spinning cube that does nothing useful!](/screenshot.png?raw=true)

Runs in browser using WebGL / THREE.js.

Developed as a project for a Computer Graphics class.

WASD to move, QE to rotate.

Status
------
Nothing in the way of gameplay yet, just a small hardcoded area to wander around in.
